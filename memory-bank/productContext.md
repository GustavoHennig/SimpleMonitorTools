# Product Context

### Problem
Multi-monitor users often need certain apps to open on a specific display.  
Manually dragging windows is repetitive and error-prone.

### Solution
Simple Monitor Tool sits in the system-tray and lets users pre-assign an executable to a monitor. One click â†’ app appears on the correct screen.

### User Experience Goals
* **Frustration-free:** zero learning curve; no bloated UI.
* **Always-available:** starts with Windows (optional) and never clutters the task-bar.
* **Safe:** never requires admin rights; stores settings in user profile only.

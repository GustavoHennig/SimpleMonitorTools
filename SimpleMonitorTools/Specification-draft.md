# Simple Monitor Tool

A lightweight tray application for launching programs on a specific monitor.

- **Always runs in the system tray**—no main window.  
- Lets you **create shortcuts to executables**.  
- Each shortcut has a **monitor selector** (drop-down) and an **executable-path field**.  
- A small configuration window appears only when you manage shortcuts; there you can **add or remove links**.  
- **Built with Avalonia UI**.  
- **All settings are saved as JSON** in the user’s AppData folder.

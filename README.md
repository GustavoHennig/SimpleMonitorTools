# Simple Monitor Tool

Simple Monitor Tool is a lightweight app that sits in your system tray and helps you organize how your programs open across multiple monitors.

## What It Does

- **Create shortcuts** that open a program directly on the monitor you choose.
- **One click** from the tray icon to launch programs exactly where you want.
- **Save your setup** — even after restarting the PC, your shortcuts and monitor selections stay.
- **Runs quietly** in the background without cluttering your taskbar.
- **Works safely** without needing admin rights and saves settings in your user profile.

## Why Use It

If you have multiple monitors, you know the pain: launching a program and manually dragging it to the correct screen every time.  
Simple Monitor Tool makes it automatic — just click, and the app appears on the right monitor.

## How It Works

1. Add shortcuts using a simple window (opened from the tray).
2. Pick which monitor each shortcut should use.
3. Click the shortcut from the tray menu anytime you want to launch it.
4. Done! No more dragging windows around.

- No installation needed — just run the app.
